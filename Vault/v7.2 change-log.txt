Summary of changes :

  - Added russian translation by Silent and Aldark from arcanecoast.ru

  - Added a new component for compatibility with Item Revisions.
It adds modified upgraded items so you don't waste money on downgrades.
Also installs the base items so if you don't install IR but install this component you will have some items replaced by IR versions.

  - Balanced some items effects. 

  - Fixed all weapons as they weren't using any proficiency type or enchantment level.

  - Replaced some of the custom items (that were just copied from BG2) with their BG2 counterpart.

  - Replaced some creatures spawns with stock BG2 ones. (Stone Golems, Greater Basilisks, etc..)

  - Fixed some creatures stats/immunities/weapon effects/animations. (1 vampire and 1 golem)

  - Fixed some dialogues.

  - Lowered some trap removal requirements so they can be disarmed

  - Heavily modified drows override script to allow for other scripts to be read. Mainly for SCS/BP AI enhancements.

  - Gandolar Luckyfoot (Mayor of Gullykin) shouldn't disappear anymore.

  - Ghost Knights inside Firewine Ruins will not take the ancient armor from you anymore so it can be kept to obtain the Vampire's revenge and eventually access the vault.

  - Vampire's revenge can now only be obtained after you have shown the History of the Nether Scrolls to Ulcaster

  - Drow items (sword/crossbow/chainmail) can now be collected and used.
They will decay in sunlight and turn into materials used for Melicamp robes upgrades.
Those were previously looted already broken from the drows.

  - Slightly lowered some XP gains. Increased some prices for item upgrades.

  - Lowered potions of extra healing supplies.

  - Deprecated messy lvl-50 ruleset that was previously installed with the mod.

  - Deprecated area patching of ARA101 (Charleston digging site tomb)
Replaced by a duplicate of that same area to avoid mod conflicts and makes it a truly buried/remote/unaccessible tomb

  - Vestibule quest demon encounter in Wood of Sharp Teeth will happen even if you previously killed the Red Wizards.
In a future update I will likely come back on that change and just add a new dialog option with Kelddath if you have already killed them.

  - Various misc. enhancements/fixes
