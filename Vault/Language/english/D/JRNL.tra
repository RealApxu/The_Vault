@0   = ~The leader of the Drow party has been slain. You take comfort that your deed will bring some measure of peace back to the hardy miners of Nashkel... that is, until the Drow find out about their slain brethren and retaliate for the offense rendered to the Spider Queen Lloth.~
@1   = ~ With the recovery of the archaic tome, I have put a close to the thief Zernan and his obsessive ramblings... or have I? Why would such an individual, even a group of rogues, go to such ends to possess this book? Perhaps there is some shred of truth to what they claim. It would not have lured such evil as the drow from the recesses of Faerun so close to the surface otherwise. They are not a race who would venture into the domain of the peoples of the Sword Coast for no simple reason. Maybe it was to unlock something hidden in the text? ...ah, enough of this. For now, I must go on and seek out the Iron Throne leaders. I will have look into the tome another day, when I have the time and energy to expend.~
@2   = ~With the recovery of the archaic tome and the death of the drow expeditionary force in the Nashkel Mines, I think I have put a close to the search for Zernan. Amongst the items gathered from the drow, I found a familiar article of clothing that seems to have belonged the intrepid scholar. Nandin will be most displeased with this.~
